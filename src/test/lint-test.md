# Test Markdown

This line is too long and should be wrapped because it exceeds our configured
limit of 80 characters in markdown files according to our settings.

## Missing space after heading

- Incorrect indentation

* Mixed list markers

- Should use consistent markers
  - Over-indented list item

```typescript
// Code block with issues
var x = 'should use const';
function noReturn(param: any) {
  console.log('test');
}
```

- Trailing space follows
  - Inconsistent indentation Missing new line at end of file
